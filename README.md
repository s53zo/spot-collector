# spot-collector
Connect to different dx-clusters and merges them into one service. Similar to wintelnetx.

I use it to connect to DXCLUSTER such as S50DXS at cluster.s53m.com on 8000 and to local skimmer servers
to merge all the spots comming to my logging software.

I start the script with SystemD using the provide .service file.
